# Elevator iOS Game

This game was originally created during a 24-hour game jam then was submitted to the WWDC scholarship competition.

It is a simple game where you serve as a bellhop moving the elevator up and down floors to pick up passengers and get them to their floors as quickly as possible.

I am planning to release this to the app store after finding a game designer and artist willing to work on it.

This game is wrapped in a playground so you will have to open it up in Xcode 8 to fully expereience it.
